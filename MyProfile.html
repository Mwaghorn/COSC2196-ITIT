    <h1><strong>My Profile</strong></h1>
    <p>Name: Mitchell Waghorn<br />Studnet Number: S3926443<br />Student Email: S3926443@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

       <h2><strong>Personal Information</strong></h2>
       <img src="Photo ID.jpg" alt="Photo of Myself" style="width:300px;text-align: center"/>
       <p>
           My name is Mitchell Waghorn, and I was born in Australia. My father was born in England and my mother
           in Australia. I actually have never left the country and COVID-19 is not making it any easier. I dropped
           out of high school in year 11 and started working full time. Eventually started working for my father’s
           window tinting business, but don’t see it as a long-term career for me as my interests lie elsewhere.<br /><br />
           I have quite an expensive hobby, building mechanical keyboards. I find the building process interesting 
           and fun, and nothing is more satisfying than making a keyboard that feels amazing to type on and sounds perfect.

        <h2><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I have been heavily interested in IT since a young age. I remember opening my parents’ computer in around
            2011 while I was in primary school to clean out the dust as it was overheating. I learnt how to do it through
            videos on YouTube. Early in high school I bought my first computer parts and assembled my first computer. Since
            then, I have kept up with all the new hardware and have been assembling and repairing computers for friends
            and family. I also am interested in software engineering and have learnt the fundamentals of C#, Java, HTML and CSS.
            <br /><br />The reason I chose to study at RMIT is that the online format suits my needs as I still need to work
            full time. The RMIT Canvas website is very intuitive, and I am enjoying it so far. While studying at RMIT I expect 
            to develop the necessary skills required to start my career in IT. I also expect to discover the variety of career 
            outcomes available to me. Now I wish to do software engineering, but as I progress through my degree, I may find 
            something which interests me more.

        <h2><strong>Ideal Job</strong></h2>
        <img src="ApplicationPic.png" alt="Screenshot of job application" style=" width:400px" /><br />
        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53931887?type=standard#searchRequestToken=ae60eba5-c943-48dd-8c70-38960d4cee77">Application Link</a>
        <p>
            This role appeals to me as software engineering has been my interest for a while now. The idea of creating applications
            or working on existing applications to improve them is very interesting to me and would love to be able to do it as a career
            rather than a hobby. Collaborating in a team environment and being able to learn of one another is also what I want from my
            ideal job.<br /><br />
            I believe this job requires good interpersonal skills such as clear communication and the ability to get along with peers.
            It requires 2 years’ experience with TypeScript and NodeJS and a degree in IT or computer science. They want an understanding
            of SQL and Relational Databases. It is not required to have experience with data streaming although it is recommended. Some
            skills that the job requires includes self-motivation and an eye for detail.<br /><br />
            Currently I know Microsoft SQL and Relational Databases and I feel that I am self-motivated with an eye for detail. I am 
            currently working towards my degree in IT which will help me achieve the necessary knowledge and skills for the job. As for 
            the languages and software they require I will be able to teach myself as I did for the other coding languages I know.

        <h2><strong>Personal Profile</strong></h2>
        <p>Personality tests are a commonly used by employers to find out important information of their future employees. I have 
        taken three tests and their results are below.</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Myer-Briggs personality test = Consul ESFJ-T</li>
                <li>Vark Questionnaire learning style test = Strong kinesthetic</li>
                <li>TestMyCreativity.com = 49.79</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><strong>What do these results mean to me?</strong></h3>
        <p>
            I think these results are accurate and to me, they help me reinforce how I think about myself. The consul personally type is likely
            to be a good leader, but in my own mind I always want to lead in a group, but I am worried that I will be judged or if I do bad people’s
            opinions of me will be worse. However, in the situations where I do lead, I feel like I’m doing a very good job. Other characteristics
            include being extraverted, observant, feeling and judging which I feel is pretty accurate to how I saw myself originally.<br /><br />
            Strong kinaesthetic learners learn best with practical exercised and experiences applying the learning material in real life situations.
            Which I believed was my preferred learning style already, reinforcing my belief that this is the best way for me to learn. For me to best
            take advantage of this learning style at university I should use lots of examples when writing notes and study using practicals rather
            than reading from a textbook.<br /><br />
            As for the creativity test that I took, I scored below the average of 62.96 with a score of 49.79. To me this doesn’t mean a lot as I believe 
            as I become more confident in the field that I am learning about I will be more will to take risks and be more creative. But when learning I 
            am more suited to stick to the learning materials.

        <h2><strong>Project Idea</strong></h2>
        <div>
            <h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
            <p>In summary the project is designed to help people keep track of all their medical data. The app will hold information inputted by your doctor 
            such as appointment history, upcoming appointments, allergies, dietary requirements, prescriptions and medications. Implemented QR codes for 
            pharmacists to use to obtain your prescription data and push notifications and check boxes to remind and incentivise the users to keep track of 
            and take their medications. Push notifications for upcoming appointments and important information your doctor may need to send you. All accessible 
            on one application making it easier for your doctor and yourself.</p>
        </div>    
        <div>
            <h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3>
            <p>Almost everyone, even the elderly are using smart phones, either android or IOS, and 65 per cent of adults in the United States are on some form 
            of prescription drugs. Further 91 per cent of people over the age of 80 are on prescription medication (Georgetown University, 2019). Making it easier 
            for these people to keep track of their medication and prescription drugs would decrease the chances of them forgetting what to take and when to take 
            them and by giving them quick and easy access to the information about the medication, they can easily educate themselves on the importance of the 
            drugs. The applications motivation and goal to assist people in living more healthy lives and giving the individual a better understanding of what they 
            are taking.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
            <p>
                The app will have the user create an account and input data such as your Medicare and other information such as Birthdate, name and location. Once
                the user has made an account, a doctor which supports the application can connect with the user and is able to enter information for the user to view,
                such as prescriptions, a summary of their doctor’s visit, dietary requirements, and the times and amount of the prescription drugs to take.<br /><br />
                There will be two separate versions of the app. The doctor’s app and the patient app. For a doctor to create an account they must supply the supporting
                documentation to prove that they are a doctor, and they are also who they say they are. Once they have an account, they then have a list of their
                patients which they have connected with and the option to request to add a patient and request to remove a patient. When the doctor needs to send a
                message or update information for a patient they can simply click on the patient, select the category (prescriptions, dietary, general, etc..) and write
                the message. Another feature will be a send-all which will let the doctor send out a message to all patients about important information about COVID-19
                or other issues. Doctors can also see what other doctors have prescribed and treated you for without having to ask.<br /><br />
                From the patient’s perspective they will sign up for the account and after this any outstanding requests for a doctor to connect with them will be shown 
                and must be accepted or declined before continuing. Now the patient will be on the main screen where they will view the applications UI. There will be a 
                list of all the important categories such as, doctors, prescriptions, medication reminders, appointments, personal information and emergency contact numbers 
                like 000, and your local emergency facility. The doctors tab will hold information on all your doctors which you have connected with, including the office 
                they work at and how to get in contact with them. The prescriptions tab will let the patient keep track of their prescriptions, have an image of what the 
                pill will look like and supply links to important resources about the medication. The medication reminders let you view when and how many of your 
                medications you should be taking each day. This is inputted by your doctor to save you the confusion of having to enter it yourself. This includes being 
                set push notifications for when you should be taking the medication. The appointment tab will display all your upcoming and previous appointments as well 
                as who to contact if you have an enquiry (reception or the doctor themselves). The personal information tab will be inputted by yourself and is only visible 
                by the doctors you accept. This includes name, address, age, weight and more.

        <div>
            <h3><strong>Tools and Technologies</strong></h3>
            <p>The application will be available on android and IOS devices for patients but for the doctors they can access it on Windows and OSX as well as they will most 
            likely want to access it from their office.  The app needs to be available across all platforms so needs to be developed with a language that enables the app to 
            be Hybrid rather than native. The app will most likely use a language like C# which is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language or a form of JavaScript such 
            as react. The IEE used will most likely be Visual Studio as it has a lot of support and is free.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><strong>Skills Required</strong></h3>
            <p>Skills required for the project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Computer and mobile operating skill.</li>
                <li>Know how to use Visual Studio.</li>
                <li>Basic knowledge of how to use C# and how to build a UI with XAML and the WPF Designer.</li>
                <li>Knowledge of GitHub for collarboration with colleagues.</li>
                <li>Research skills to implement medical research into the application.</li>
                <li>Communication skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these skills are relatively easy to learn as there is an abundance of resources online to help. People working on this application will need a computer, either 
            running windows or OSX and a smart phone, either running android or IOS.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><strong>Outcome</strong></h3>
            <p>With this application fully developed I believe it can help doctors and patients. Patients having quick and easy access to all the helpful resources they need plus 
            push notifications to make sure they remember to take their medications and doctors now have an easier way to keep track of how the patient is doing in terms of 
            medication, personal information, and previous appointments they have made. This app will reduce the number of times a patient will forget to take their medication.</p>
